Given an array of n distinct non-empty strings, you need to generate minimal possible abbreviations for every word
following rules below.

Begin with the first character and then the number of characters abbreviated, which followed by the last character.
If there are any conflict, that is more than one words share the same abbreviation, a longer prefix is used instead of
only the first character until making the map from word to abbreviation become unique. In other words, a final
abbreviation cannot map to more than one original words.
If the abbreviation doesn't make the word shorter, then keep it as original.
Example:
Input: ["like", "god", "internal", "me", "internet", "interval", "intension", "face", "intrusion"]
Output: ["l2e","god","internal","me","i6t","interval","inte4n","f2e","intr4n"]
Note:
Both n and the length of each word will not exceed 400.
The length of each word is greater than 1.
The words consist of lowercase English letters only.
The return answers should be in the same order as the original array.

------------------------------------------------

The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.

By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.

Note:
The read function may be called multiple times.

------------------------------------------------

Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

Note:
Given target value is a floating point.
You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
Follow up:
Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?
